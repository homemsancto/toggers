			<p>Solaire is a Warrior of Sunlight who is determined to find "his very own sun".[1] His faith is upstanding and unwavering,[2] and all holy symbols on Solaire's belongings were painted by himself.[3] Solaire claims to be an adherent of the Lord of Sunlight.[1] His incredible prowess is attributed to training and high-quality equipment, and despite the holy symbols on his equipment, neither Solaire nor his possessions are blessed or enchanted.[4] His attempts to find his sun led him through Anor Londo, Blighttown, the Tomb of the Giants and Lost Izalith.[1] When he goes to Lost Izalith, Solaire may become parasitised by a Sunlight Maggot, a creature known to emit a blinding light when worn on the head.[5] When he finds the maggot, Solaire goes insane, claiming the maggot was the sun he was searching for and attacks the Chosen Undead on sight.[1]

			<p> The nature of Solaire's "very own sun" remains unclear. During normal gameplay, Solaire will most likely find the Sunlight Maggot and lose his mind due to his desperation.[1] However, if the Chosen Undead prevents him from finding the maggot, Solaire can be summoned for the fight against Gwyn. Having reached the Kiln of the First Flame, it is possible that Solaire "finds his sun" by linking the fire. Solaire's legacy is remembered in both Drangleic and Lothric. In Drangleic, the image of a "hero of yore" was painted onto the Sunlight Parma,[6] an item given to the Bearer of the Curse for offering Sunlight Medals to the Heirs of the Sun. Solaire's sword is also given to the bearer as a reward from the same covenant. At this point, it still exhibits no special properties beyond its high quality. In Lothric, Solaire is remembered as the Knight of Sunlight, and all of his belongings can be found by the Ashen One. Though most of them still lack special powers, his sword has been imbued with the power of the sun, and is said to be a relic of a "one-sided adoration."[7] His talisman also "fills the user with similar steadfastness" to Solaire's own, providing a stronger Unfaltering Prayer than other talismans.</p>
